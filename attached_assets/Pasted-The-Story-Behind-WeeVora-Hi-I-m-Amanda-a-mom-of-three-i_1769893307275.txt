The Story Behind WeeVora
Hi! I'm Amanda, a mom of three in Mundelein, Illinois, and I created WeeVora because I learned the hard way that summer camp planning in our area is no joke.
Back when my oldest was in kindergarten, I thought I was ahead of the game. It was March—snow still on the ground in Mundelein—and I confidently sat down to register for summer camps. Surely I was early, right?
Wrong.
Everything was already booked. Full waitlists. Programs I didn't even know existed in Lake County, gone. I scrambled to piece together a summer from whatever spots were left at our park district and the few camps I knew about in Mundelein, Libertyville, and Lake Forest.
That frustrating experience stuck with me. As my family grew to three kids, the juggling act only got more complicated. Different ages, different interests, different schedules across multiple Lake County communities. Spreadsheets, browser tabs, sticky notes—it was chaos. I kept thinking: there has to be a better way to see all the Lake County options in one place.
So I built one.
What Started as a Personal Tool
WeeVora began as a hobby project—something I made for myself to visualize Lake County camps, activities, and our family schedule in one place. No more forgotten registration deadlines. No more wondering if there was a better camp in Gurnee or Vernon Hills I'd missed. Just a simple, visual way to see everything happening in our area and plan with confidence.
But as I built it, I realized other Lake County parents were probably dealing with the same overwhelm. The same mad scramble every spring. The same feeling of being one step behind while navigating options across Mundelein, Libertyville, Lake Forest, Gurnee, Vernon Hills, and beyond.
That's when I decided to add some structure, polish it up, and share it with our community. If this tool could save even one Lake County parent from my March snow-day panic, it would be worth it.
Where We're Going
What started as a Lake County summer camp planner is growing into something bigger. I'm adding year-round activities available in our area, crafts for rainy days, kid-friendly recipes, and resources for school breaks. Basically, anything that helps busy Lake County families like ours weave together a full, fun, and organized year.
This is still very much a work in progress, and I have plenty of dreams and ideas for features that might be worthwhile. I'm committed to keep building this out going forward, focusing on what matters most to families right here in Lake County.

Why "WeeVora"?
The name WeeVora comes from my three kids: Weston, Everett, and Cora. It also represents what we're doing here—weaving together camps, activities, crafts, and plans into one beautiful, organized picture.
Because parenting is already hard enough. Planning summer in Lake County shouldn't make it harder.
Thanks for being here. Let's weave something great together.
